Matt Basta's Random Crap

Index:

8ball/
A project I made about half a decade ago. Gives an accurate response on behalf
of Jeff Mancini when asked a question regarding a client project.

bork.php
A fun little translator to how the Swedish Chef would pronounce things.

browserstress.html
I wrote it to scare the crap out of a teacher once. Put this bad boy full
screen and it'll make them think you're about to launch a missile. Now I use
it to stress out new browsers and see how they run.

lolcano.html
The name is self-explanatory.

physicsisnotbingo.php
A clone of barackobamaisyournewbicycle.com

study tools/solmem.html
A tool I wrote to help me memorize the "To be or not to be" soliloquy.

min-height/
This directory has a little demo that I put together when I was 17 while
working at Solid Cactus Inc. It was a way to apply min-height to an element
in IE6. Unfortunately, IE8 came out right around that time and nobody cared
because IE6 was making its death march.

spider/
This is a crappy little web spider that I wrote a few years ago in PHP. It
wasn't designed to be the next Google, it was designed to be a slick little
tool that I could use to create visualizations of the net and such.
